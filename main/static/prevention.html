        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
        Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
        Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
        Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
        Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
        Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
        Stay home if you feel unwell.
        If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
        Masks
        Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.

        Improving Ventilation and Spending Time Outdoors
placeholder-image
Improving ventilation (moving air into, out of, or within a room) and filtration (trapping particles on a filter to remove them from the air) can help prevent virus particles from accumulating in indoor air. Improving ventilation and filtration can help protect you from getting infected with and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Spending time outside when possible instead of inside can also help: Viral particles spread between people more readily indoors than outdoors.

    Moving indoor activities outdoors
You are less likely to be infected with COVID-19 during outdoor activities because virus particles do not build up in the air outdoors as much as they do indoors. As the COVID-19 Community Level rises, consider increasing the number of group activities you move outside.

Getting Tested for COVID-19 If Needed
illustration of COVID-19 self-test
Get tested if you have COVID-19 symptoms. A viral test tells you if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. There are two types of viral tests: rapid tests and laboratory tests. These tests might use samples from your nose or throat, or saliva. Knowing if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 allows you to take care of yourself and take actions to reduce the chance that you will infect others.

CoWeCheck is an online, mobile-friendly tool that asks a series of questions and recommends actions and resources based on your responses. It can help you interpret what your test result means.
